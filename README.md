PROJECT ABSTRACT:

TerraSafe is an innovative, AI-driven solution designed to predict, prevent, and manage human-wildlife conflicts through real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and community engagement. As habitat encroachment and climate change intensify human-wildlife interactions, conflicts are becoming more frequent, leading to loss of life, property damage, and harm to biodiversity. TerraSafe addresses these challenges by integrating cutting-edge technologies to provide a proactive, data-driven approach to conflict mitigation.
The system leverages a network of motion detectors, cameras, and GPS collars to monitor wildlife movements in real-time.

Using AI-powered computer vision and anomaly detection, TerraSafe detects wildlife presence near human settlements and sends instant alerts to communities and authorities via a mobile app and web dashboard. This early warning system enables timely preventive measures, reducing the risk of conflicts. 
In addition to real-time monitoring,TerraSafe employs predictive analytics to identify conflict hotspots. By analyzing historical data, environmental variables, and land-use patterns, the system generates heatmaps and risk zones using geospatial tools like Google Earth Engine. These insights empower policymakers and conservationists to implement targeted strategies, such as wildlife corridors or community awareness programs.

A key feature of TerraSafe is its community engagement platform, which allows local residents to report wildlife sightings and incidents through a mobile app. The app uses AI-powered NLP and image recognition to analyze reports, identify patterns, and provide real-time guidance to users. This fosters collaboration between communities and conservationists, creating a shared responsibility for conflict mitigation.
It is designed to adapt to diverse ecosystems and conflict scenarios, making it a versatile tool for global conservation efforts. This project represents a significant step forward in leveraging technology for sustainable conservation and community safety.
